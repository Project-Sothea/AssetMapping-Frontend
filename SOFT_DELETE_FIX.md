# ✅ Soft Delete Fix Applied

## What Was Changed

### Issue

The initial backend integration used **hard deletes** (removing records from database):

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Hard delete
await supabase.from('pins').delete().eq('id', pinId);
```

This conflicted with your app's **soft delete pattern** (setting `deleted_at` timestamp).

### Solution

Changed to **soft deletes** to match your existing architecture:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Soft delete
await supabase
  .from('pins')
  .update({
    deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
  .eq('id', pinId);
```

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `apis/Pins/index.ts`

**Before:**

```typescript
export const deletePin = async (pinId: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase.from('pins').delete().eq('id', pinId);
};
```

**After:**

```typescript
export const deletePin = async (pinId: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('pins')
    .update({
      deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(), // ✅ Soft delete
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    })
    .eq('id', pinId);
};
```

### 2. `apis/Forms/index.ts`

**Before:**

```typescript
export const deleteForm = async (formId: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase.from('forms').delete().eq('id', formId);
};
```

**After:**

```typescript
export const deleteForm = async (formId: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('forms')
    .update({
      deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(), // ✅ Soft delete
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    })
    .eq('id', formId);
};
```

## Why This Matters

### ✅ Multi-Device Sync

- Device A deletes pin → Sets `deleted_at = 2025-10-18T12:00:00Z`
- Device B syncs → Sees `deleted_at`, marks local pin as deleted
- **Both devices in sync!** ✅

### ✅ Audit Trail

- Can see what was deleted and when
- Useful for debugging and analytics

### ✅ Undo Capability

- Can restore deleted items by setting `deleted_at = null`

### ✅ Conflict Resolution

- Timestamps allow proper conflict resolution
- Last change wins based on `deleted_at` vs `updated_at`

### ✅ Consistent with Existing Code

- Your `PinService` already uses soft delete
- Your sync handlers expect `deleted_at` field
- No breaking changes needed

## Testing

### Test Delete Operation

1. **Delete a pin** in the app
2. **Check logs**:

   ```
   [Supabase] Syncing pin: delete abc123
   ✓ Completed: DELETE pin:abc123
   ```

3. **Verify in Supabase Dashboard**:

   - Go to Table Editor → `pins`
   - Find the deleted pin
   - Should have `deleted_at` timestamp ✅
   - Record still exists (not removed) ✅

4. **Verify on other devices**:
   - Sync on another device
   - Pin should be filtered out of UI
   - Pin still in database with `deleted_at` set

## What Happens Now

### Delete Flow (Correct)

```
User taps delete
   ↓
Local: Set deletedAt = NOW (soft delete)
   ↓
Queue: Enqueue delete operation
   ↓
Process: Call PinsAPI.deletePin(id)
   ↓
Supabase: UPDATE pins SET deleted_at = NOW  ✅
   ↓
Other devices: Sync and see deleted_at
   ↓
All devices: Mark pin as deleted locally
   ✅ Perfect sync across devices!
```

### What Would Have Happened with Hard Delete (Wrong)

```
User taps delete
   ↓
Local: Set deletedAt = NOW (soft delete)
   ↓
Queue: Enqueue delete operation
   ↓
Process: Call PinsAPI.deletePin(id)
   ↓
Supabase: DELETE FROM pins WHERE id = ...  ❌
   ↓
Other devices: Sync, but record is gone
   ↓
Other devices: Don't know pin was deleted
   ❌ Zombie records! Sync broken!
```

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: Delete operations now use soft delete (set `deleted_at`)  
✅ **Consistent**: Matches your existing soft delete pattern  
✅ **Multi-device**: Sync works correctly across devices  
✅ **No breaking changes**: Existing code continues to work  
✅ **Auditable**: Can track what was deleted and when

**Everything is now aligned and ready to test!** 🎉
