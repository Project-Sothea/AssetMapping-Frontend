## How to Test

### Step 1: Restart App

- [ ] Restart your Expo/React Native app
- [ ] Migration applies automatically
- [ ] Check console: "Database migration in progress..."
- [ ] Wait for: "Database migration complete"
- [ ] Check for sync_queue table creation

### Step 2: Test Pin Creation (Offline)

- [ ] Enable airplane mode / turn off WiFi
- [ ] Go to map screen
- [ ] Drop a new pin
- [ ] Fill in details (name, type, etc.)
- [ ] Submit
- [ ] ‚úì Pin appears on map immediately
- [ ] ‚úì Sync button shows "(1 queued)"

### Step 3: Test Batch Operations (Offline)

- [ ] Create 2 more pins
- [ ] Update an existing pin
- [ ] Delete a pin
- [ ] ‚úì All operations work offline
- [ ] ‚úì Sync button shows "(4 queued)" or similar

### Step 4: Test Sync (Online)

- [ ] Turn WiFi back on
- [ ] Wait 5 minutes OR tap sync button manually
- [ ] Watch console logs:
  ```
  üì¶ Processing 4 queued operations...
    ‚Üí Processing: create/pin/Test Pin
    ‚úì Completed: create/pin/Test Pin
    ...
  ‚úì Batch complete: 4/4 successful
  ```
- [ ] ‚úì Sync button shows "Synced"
- [ ] ‚úì Operations synced to backend

### Step 5: Test Forms (Same Process)

- [ ] Go offline
- [ ] Create/update/delete forms
- [ ] ‚úì Works offline
- [ ] Go online and sync
- [ ] ‚úì Forms sync successfully

### Step 6: Test Auto-Sync

- [ ] Leave app open for 5 minutes
- [ ] Queue should process automatically
- [ ] Check console for automatic sync logs

### Step 7: Check Database

- [ ] Open Drizzle Studio (if available)
- [ ] Look at `sync_queue` table
- [ ] Should see:
  - Completed operations (status = 'completed')
  - Or empty if everything synced
  - Failed operations (status = 'failed') if any errors

---

## Expected Console Output

### When Creating Pin Offline:

```
‚úì Enqueued: create/pin/New Pin [a1b2c3d4]
```

### When Syncing:

```
üì¶ Processing 3 queued operations...
  ‚Üí Processing: create/pin/New Pin
  [Simulated] Sent to backend: create/pin/New Pin
  ‚úì Completed: create/pin/New Pin
  ‚Üí Processing: update/pin/Another Pin
  [Simulated] Sent to backend: update/pin/Another Pin
  ‚úì Completed: update/pin/Another Pin
  ‚Üí Processing: delete/pin/Old Pin
  [Simulated] Sent to backend: delete/pin/Old Pin
  ‚úì Completed: delete/pin/Old Pin
‚úì Batch complete: 3/3 successful
```

### When Operation Fails:

```
  ‚Üí Processing: create/pin/Test Pin
  ‚úñ Failed: create/pin/Test Pin - Simulated network error
  ‚è±Ô∏è  Will retry create/pin/Test Pin in 1000ms (attempt 1/3)
```

## Verification Checklist

### UI Verification

- [ ] Pins can be created offline
- [ ] Pins can be updated offline
- [ ] Pins can be deleted offline
- [ ] Forms can be created offline
- [ ] Forms can be updated offline
- [ ] Forms can be deleted offline
- [ ] Sync button shows queue count
- [ ] Manual sync works
- [ ] Auto-sync works (every 5 min)

### Technical Verification

- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No console errors (except expected simulation failures)
- [ ] sync_queue table created in database
- [ ] Queue operations logged to console
- [ ] Idempotency working (duplicate operations blocked)
- [ ] Retry logic working (failed operations retry 3x)
- [ ] Status bar updates live

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module '~/services/sync/queue'"

**Solution**: Restart Metro bundler

```bash
# Stop Metro (Ctrl+C)
# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start -c
```

### Issue: Migration not applying

**Solution**: Check app/\_layout.tsx

- Should have: `useMigrations(db, migrations)`
- Check console for migration errors

### Issue: Queue not processing

**Solution**: Check console logs

- Should see: "‚úì Enqueued: ..." when operations added
- Should see: "üì¶ Processing..." when queue runs
- If not, check: `processQueueNow()` is being called

### Issue: "simulateBackendSync" in logs

**Solution**: This is expected!

- Phase 1 uses simulation
- Phase 2 will replace with real backend calls
- For now, it's testing the queue logic

---

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Everything Works:

1. ‚úÖ Keep using the queue system
2. ‚úÖ Monitor console logs for issues
3. ‚úÖ Gather user feedback
4. Consider Phase 2: Real backend integration

### If Issues Found:

1. Check console errors
2. Check `QUEUE_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` troubleshooting section
3. Review `USAGE_EXAMPLES.ts` for correct usage
4. Test with the examples in USAGE_EXAMPLES.ts

---

## Performance Notes

- Queue processes max 10 operations per batch (configurable)
- Auto-sync every 5 minutes (to avoid battery drain)
- Manual sync available anytime via button
- Operations retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Old completed operations cleaned up after 7 days

---

## Summary

üéâ **Queue system integrated and ready!**

‚úÖ All pin/form operations queue for sync  
‚úÖ Offline-first architecture in place  
‚úÖ Automatic retry on failures  
‚úÖ Real-time status updates  
‚úÖ Idempotency guarantees  
‚úÖ Production-ready logging

**Just restart your app and start testing!** üöÄ
