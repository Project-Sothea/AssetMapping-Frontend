# Soft Delete Pattern - Implementation & Rationale

## Overview

This app uses **soft deletes** instead of hard deletes for pins and forms. This document explains why and how it works.

---

## What is Soft Delete?

### Hard Delete (What We DON'T Do)

```sql
DELETE FROM pins WHERE id = 'abc123';
-- Record is permanently removed ‚ùå
```

### Soft Delete (What We DO)

```sql
UPDATE pins
SET deleted_at = '2025-10-18T12:00:00Z',
    updated_at = '2025-10-18T12:00:00Z'
WHERE id = 'abc123';
-- Record still exists but marked as deleted ‚úÖ
```

---

## Architecture

### Database Schema

**Local SQLite (`db/schema.ts`):**

```typescript
export const pins = sqliteTable('pins', {
  id: text('id').primaryKey(),
  deletedAt: text('deleted_at'), // NULL = active, ISO timestamp = deleted
  updatedAt: text('updated_at'),
  // ... other fields
});
```

**Remote Supabase (`database.types.ts`):**

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  deleted_at: string | null; // NULL = active, timestamp = deleted
  updated_at: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```

---

## Implementation

### Local Delete (PinService)

```typescript
async deletePin(id: string): Promise<Result<void>> {
  // Soft delete: set deletedAt and mark as dirty for sync
  await this.localRepo.update({
    id,
    deletedAt: new Date().toISOString(),  // ‚úÖ Mark as deleted
    status: 'dirty',                       // ‚úÖ Queue for sync
    updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
}
```

### Remote Sync (Queue ‚Üí Supabase)

**Pins API (`apis/Pins/index.ts`):**

```typescript
export const deletePin = async (pinId: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('pins')
    .update({
      deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(), // ‚úÖ Soft delete
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    })
    .eq('id', pinId);
};
```

**Forms API (`apis/Forms/index.ts`):**

```typescript
export const deleteForm = async (formId: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('forms')
    .update({
      deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(), // ‚úÖ Soft delete
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    })
    .eq('id', formId);
};
```

## Why Soft Delete?

### ‚úÖ 1. Multi-Device Sync

**Scenario**: User has 2 devices

**With Soft Delete:**

```
Device A: Delete pin ‚Üí Sets deleted_at = 2025-10-18T12:00:00Z
Device B: Syncs ‚Üí Sees deleted_at, marks local pin as deleted ‚úÖ
```

**With Hard Delete:**

```
Device A: Delete pin ‚Üí Record removed from Supabase
Device B: Syncs ‚Üí Doesn't know pin was deleted ‚ùå
Result: Pin stays on Device B (zombie record) üëª
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Conflict Resolution

**Scenario**: Two devices edit the same pin while offline

**With Soft Delete:**

```
Device A (offline): Edits pin at 12:00, updated_at = 12:00
Device B (offline): Deletes pin at 12:30, deleted_at = 12:30
Both sync: Compare timestamps ‚Üí 12:30 > 12:00 ‚Üí Delete wins ‚úÖ
```

**With Hard Delete:**

```
Device A: Edits pin
Device B: Hard deletes pin
Both sync: Pin recreated from Device A's edit (resurrection) üëª
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Audit Trail

**Benefits:**

- See what was deleted and when
- Track user actions for analytics
- Debug sync issues
- Generate reports ("10 pins deleted this month")

```sql
-- Find recently deleted pins
SELECT * FROM pins
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY deleted_at DESC;

-- Count deletions per day
SELECT DATE(deleted_at), COUNT(*)
FROM pins
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE(deleted_at);
```

### ‚úÖ 4. Undo Capability

**Restore deleted item:**

```typescript
// Undo delete (if needed in future)
await supabase
  .from('pins')
  .update({
    deleted_at: null, // ‚úÖ Restore
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
  .eq('id', pinId);
```

### ‚úÖ 5. Data Integrity

**Prevents cascading issues:**

```
Pin has forms attached
Hard delete pin ‚Üí Forms reference deleted pin (orphaned) ‚ùå
Soft delete pin ‚Üí Forms still reference valid record ‚úÖ
```

---

## Filtering Deleted Records

### In Queries

**Local (Drizzle):**

```typescript
// Get only active pins
const activePins = await db
  .select()
  .from(pins)
  .where(isNull(pins.deletedAt)) // ‚úÖ Filter out deleted
  .all();
```

**Remote (Supabase):**

```typescript
// Sync only active records
const { data } = await supabase.from('pins').select('*').is('deleted_at', null); // ‚úÖ Filter out deleted
```

**UI Hook (`usePins.ts`):**

```typescript
const { data: pins } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['pins'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const allPins = await db.select().from(pins).all();
    // Filter out soft-deleted pins
    return allPins.filter((pin) => !pin.deletedAt); // ‚úÖ
  },
});
```

---

## Sync Flow

### Delete Operation Flow

```
1. User taps delete button
   ‚Üì
2. PinService.deletePin()
   - Sets deletedAt = NOW
   - Sets status = 'dirty'
   - Updates updatedAt = NOW
   ‚Üì
3. Save to local SQLite
   - Pin still in database
   - Marked with deletedAt timestamp
   ‚Üì
4. Enqueue for sync
   - Operation: 'delete'
   - EntityType: 'pin'
   - Data: { id, deletedAt, updatedAt }
   ‚Üì
5. Queue processes operation
   - Calls PinsAPI.deletePin(id)
   ‚Üì
6. Update Supabase
   - UPDATE pins SET deleted_at = NOW
   - Record persists with deleted_at set
   ‚Üì
7. Other devices sync
   - See deleted_at timestamp
   - Mark local records as deleted
   ‚úÖ All devices in sync!
```

## Cleanup Strategy

### Option 1: Never Delete (Recommended)

**Pros:**

- Complete audit trail
- Can restore anything
- Disk space is cheap

**Cons:**

- Database grows over time
- Queries need to filter deleted records

### Option 2: Scheduled Cleanup

**Delete records after N days:**

```typescript
// Run monthly via cron job
async function cleanupOldDeletes() {
  const cutoff = new Date();
  cutoff.setDate(cutoff.getDate() - 90); // 90 days ago

  await supabase
    .from('pins')
    .delete()
    .lt('deleted_at', cutoff.toISOString())
    .not('deleted_at', 'is', null); // Only delete soft-deleted records
}
```

### Option 3: Archive Table

**Move to archive instead of cleanup:**

```sql
-- Archive old deleted records
INSERT INTO pins_archive
SELECT * FROM pins
WHERE deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';

DELETE FROM pins
WHERE deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Index for Performance

```sql
-- Add index on deleted_at for fast filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_pins_deleted_at ON pins(deleted_at);

-- Partial index for active records only
CREATE INDEX idx_pins_active ON pins(id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Query Optimization

```typescript
// ‚ùå Slow: Scans all records
const pins = await db.select().from(pins).all();
const active = pins.filter((p) => !p.deletedAt);

// ‚úÖ Fast: Filters at database level
const active = await db.select().from(pins).where(isNull(pins.deletedAt)).all();
```

---

## Migration Notes

### If Switching from Hard Delete

**Step 1: Add deleted_at column** (Already done ‚úÖ)

```sql
ALTER TABLE pins ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
```

**Step 2: Update delete logic** (Just completed ‚úÖ)

```typescript
// Changed from:
await supabase.from('pins').delete().eq('id', pinId);

// To:
await supabase.from('pins').update({ deleted_at: NOW }).eq('id', pinId);
```

**Step 3: Update queries** (Already done ‚úÖ)

```typescript
// Add .is('deleted_at', null) to all queries
```

---

## Testing Soft Deletes

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Delete

```typescript
// 1. Create pin
const pin = await createPin({ name: 'Test' });

// 2. Delete pin
await deletePin(pin.id);

// 3. Verify still in database
const allPins = await db.select().from(pins).all();
expect(allPins.find((p) => p.id === pin.id)).toBeDefined();

// 4. Verify has deleted_at
expect(allPins.find((p) => p.id === pin.id)?.deletedAt).toBeTruthy();

// 5. Verify filtered from active list
const activePins = await getActivePins();
expect(activePins.find((p) => p.id === pin.id)).toBeUndefined();
```

### Test Scenario 2: Multi-Device Sync

```typescript
// Device A: Delete pin
await deviceA.deletePin(pinId);

// Device B: Sync
await deviceB.sync();

// Device B: Verify pin marked as deleted
const pin = await deviceB.getPin(pinId);
expect(pin.deletedAt).toBeTruthy();
```
